# 8-Queens-Problem
Finds a solution to the 8-Queens Problem using either Hill Climbing Search Algorithm or Genetic Algorithm.

To use Hill Climbing Search Algorithm: Enter 'python hill_climbing_search.py [number_of_queens] [number_of_runs]' in the Terminal.

To use Genetic Algorithm: Enter 'python genetic_algorithm.py [number_of_queens] [number_of_generations]' in the Terminal.
Each generation consists of two children whose fitness is compared with their two parents, the fittest two make up the next generation's parents.
